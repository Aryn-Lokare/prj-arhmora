                    ARHMORA - FEATURE IDEAS & ROADMAP
================================================================================

Vision: Help small companies find vulnerabilities on their websites and keep 
them protected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: AI ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. DYNAMIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (DAST) WITH AI
   - Crawling + Active Scanning: Auto-discover all pages/endpoints before testing
   - Payload Injection Testing: Safely send test attacks (SQLi, XSS) to find vulns
   - Session-Aware Scanning: Test authenticated areas behind logins

2. ANOMALY DETECTION FOR CONTINUOUS PROTECTION
   - Learn the baseline of client's normal traffic patterns
   - Detect deviations and flag unusual spikes or attack signatures
   - Use Autoencoders or Isolation Forests (unsupervised ML)
   - Turns product from one-time scan to always-on security layer

3. VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION WITH NLP
   - Analyze error messages returned by websites (stack traces, SQL errors)
   - Read HTML/JavaScript for hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords)
   - Parse CVE databases to auto-match issues to known vulnerabilities
   - Suggested Model: Fine-tune DistilBERT or CodeBERT

4. PRIORITIZED, ACTIONABLE REPORTS
   - Rank findings by exploitability (not just severity)
   - Suggest fixes in plain English
   - Estimate effort (Quick fix vs. Needs developer time)

5. THREAT INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION
   - Known malicious IPs/URLs from public threat feeds
   - Common attack patterns (OWASP Top 10 signatures)
   - Zero-day alerts from CVE/NVD feeds


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: USP & WOW FACTOR FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. AI SECURITY SCORE WITH PUBLIC BADGE
   - Verified security badge websites can display
   - Example: "🛡️ Arhmora Verified | Score: 92/100 | Last Scan: Jan 2026"
   - Creates trust signals for customers
   - Viral marketing - every badge is free advertising

2. "HACKER'S EYE VIEW" SIMULATION
   - Show business owners exactly what an attacker sees
   - Exposed admin panels, open ports, leaked emails
   - Visualize as a hacker dashboard mockup
   - Creates emotional "aha moment" that drives action

3. 1-CLICK AUTO-FIX FOR COMMON ISSUES [HIGH PRIORITY]
   - Don't just find problems - fix them
   - Generate ready-to-paste configs (.htaccess, nginx, CSP headers)
   - Offer WordPress/Shopify plugins that auto-apply fixes
   - "We found 3 issues. Click here to fix 2 of them instantly."
   - HUGE for non-technical users

4. COMPETITOR SECURITY COMPARISON
   - Let users scan competitor's website (public info only)
   - "Your score: 72. Competitor A: 85. Competitor B: 61."
   - Gamification + competitive pressure = higher engagement
   - Use only publicly available data (headers, SSL, etc.)

5. DARK WEB LEAK MONITOR
   - Check if company's data has been leaked
   - Integrate with Have I Been Pwned API or similar
   - Alert: "3 employee emails found in breach databases!"
   - Premium feature small businesses rarely have access to

6. AI CHAT ASSISTANT FOR SECURITY
   - Chatbot powered by LLM
   - Explain findings in simple terms: "What does XSS mean for my business?"
   - Answer custom questions: "Is my payment page safe?"
   - Suggest next steps: "Should I hire a developer or fix this myself?"
   - Makes security accessible to non-technical founders

7. SCHEDULED SCANS + SLACK/EMAIL ALERTS
   - Continuous monitoring with smart alerts
   - Weekly automated scans
   - Instant Slack/Discord/Email notification on new vulnerabilities
   - Monthly PDF security report (great for compliance)

8. COMPLIANCE SNAPSHOT (GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
   - Auto-check for common compliance requirements
   - Generate "Compliance Readiness Report"
   - Examples:
     ✅ HTTPS enforced
     ❌ Cookie consent missing
     ⚠️ No privacy policy detected

PART 3: 1-CLICK AUTO-FIX IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEVEL 1: COPY-PASTE FIXES (Easiest)
- For each vulnerability, generate ready-to-use code snippets
- Missing CSP Header → .htaccess or nginx.conf snippet
- No HTTPS Redirect → Server config for forced SSL
- Clickjacking Risk → X-Frame-Options header code
- Missing HSTS → Strict-Transport-Security config
- Open Directory Listing → Options -Indexes directive

LEVEL 2: DOWNLOADABLE CONFIG FILES
- Generate complete config files user can upload
- Download nginx-security.conf
- Download .htaccess
- Download web.config (for IIS)

LEVEL 3: PLATFORM-SPECIFIC PLUGINS (Advanced)
- WordPress: PHP plugin that sets headers via functions.php
- Shopify: Liquid snippet for meta tags
- Vercel/Netlify: vercel.json / netlify.toml config

FIXABLE ISSUES BY CATEGORY:
- Headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- SSL/TLS: HTTPS redirect rules, mixed content fixes
- Access Control: Directory listing disabled, admin path protection
- Forms: CSRF token snippets, input validation patterns
- Cookies: Secure + HttpOnly + SameSite flags

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:
- Phase 1: Copy-paste fixes for top 5 header issues (2-3 days)
- Phase 2: Downloadable config files + platform selector (1-2 days)
- Phase 3: WordPress plugin for auto-apply (1 week)
